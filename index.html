    Don't Forget... June 16 is national Sea Turtle Day!!!! </h2>

  <p style="text-indent:25px">1. They think jellyfish are delicious.

  Leatherbacks and hawkbill turtles feed on jellyfish and keep their populations in check. Plastic looks like jellyfish when it's floating in the water and that's why so many turtles die from ingesting plastic—they were going for a tasty snack.</p>

  <p style="text-indent:25px">2. They're the oceans' lawnmowers.

  Green sea turtles have a more plant-based diet and eat seagrass. By keeping seagrass short, they prevent it from getting tall and harming other marine creatures.</p>

  <p style="text-indent:25px">3. They cannot retract into their shell like other turtles.

  Since they don't have to protect themselves from predators for most of their life on water, sea turtles cannot retract their flippers and head into their shells. Their anatomy makes them more agile when under the sea but highly vulnerable when nesting and hatching.</p>

  <p style="text-indent:25px"> 4. Temperature dictates the sex of baby turtles.

  Warmer nests lead to more females and cooler ones lead to more males—which is why climate change could drastically affect their populations by creating too many females and too few males to match them for reproduction.</p>

  <p style="text-indent:25px"> 5. They've been around for a very, very long time.

  An estimated 110 million years is how long sea turtles have existed on Earth, which means they once shared the planet with T-Rex and other dinosaurs.</p>

  <p style="text-indent:25px">6. They can hold their breath for five hours underwater.

  To accomplish this mighty feat they slow their heart rate to up to nine minutes in between heart beats in order to conserve oxygen.

  <p style="text-indent:25px">7. They live to about 100 years.

  And that's also roughly the amount of eggs they lay every time they nest.</p>

  <p style="text-indent:25px">8. Dogs are not a sea turtle's best friend.

  Even though they're marine animals, some of their natural predators include dogs who dig up their eggs buried in the sand.</p>

  <p style="text-indent:25px">9. They have an excellent sense of direction.

  Sea turtles can detect the Earth's magnetic field and they use it as a compass.</p>

    <p style="text-indent:25px" onmouseover="makeRed(this)" onmouseout="makeBlack(this)">The Problem: Human use of nesting beaches can result

      in negative impacts to nesting turtles, incubating egg clutches and hatchlings.

      The most serious threat caused by increased human </p> <p> presence on the beach is the

      disturbance to nesting females. Night-time human activity can prevent sea turtles

       from emerging on the beach or even cause females to stop nesting and return to

      the</p> ocean. Beach Furniture and other recreational equipment (e.g., cabanas, umbrellas, hobie cats, canoes, small boats and beach cycles) can reduce nesting success and increase false crawls on nesting <p>beaches. There is also increasing documentation of

      nesting females becoming entrapped in beach furniture. Beach Driving, either at

      night or during the daytime, can negatively impact sea turtles. </p>Night time

      driving can disturb nesting females, disorient emerging hatchlings, and crush

      hatchlings attempting to reach the ocean. Tire ruts left by vehicles can extend

      the time it takes a hatchling to </p> reach the ocean and increase their chance of

      being caught by a predator. Driving during the day can cause sand compaction

      above nests resulting in lower nest success. Additionally, beach driving

      <p>contributes to erosion, especially during high tides or on narrow beaches.</p>

  <p style="font-family: monospace"> <div id= "speciesPara"> The Solution:</p></div>

  <p style="text-indent:25px">* Don’t drive on sea turtle nesting beaches;</p>
  <p style="text-indent:25px">* Make sure to fill in any holes you dig while visiting the beach ;</p>
  <p style="text-indent:25px">* Remove any beach chairs, beach umbrellas, boats, or other beach furniture each evening;</p>
  <p style="text-indent:25px">* Avoid disturbing marked sea turtle nests, and take your trash with when you leave the beach.</p>

  <br>
  <p style="text-indent:25px" onmouseover="makeRed(this)" onmouseout="makeBlack(this)">
    Case Study: There are a few studies that have looked at the direct effects of
    beach driving on sea turtles,
    and those studies support the contention that unrestricted beach driving will
    hinder sea turtle conservation efforts. Sand compaction from driving above a
    nest can decrease nesting success and kill hatchlings. Tire tracks could
    significantly impede a hatchling’s ability to reach the surf. A study conducted
    at Cape Hatteras and Cape Lookout concluded that driven beaches have higher
    percentages of false crawls and lower incubation temperatures, possibly
    resulting in a lower percentage of female hatchlings. The relationship between
    incubation period and sex ratio was determined using models for the southeastern
    United States. There are numerous possibilities for indirect and direct effects
    of beach driving on sea turtle populations. The Loggerhead Recovery Plan lists
    several of these effects including: disturbing nesting females, aborting nesting
    attempts, and disorienting hatchlings. In addition, beach driving contributes
   to erosion, which will eventually deteriorate the quality and quantity of
    nesting habitats. Increased human use and the resulting increase in sand
    compaction have been shown to decrease hatching success.
